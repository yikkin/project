## Context

The 1st April 2017, the imbalance price calculation methodology has changed (click [here](https://clients.rte-france.com/lang/fr/clients_producteurs/services_clients/dispositif_prix.jsp) for details) and has since remained the same.

Hence in this note we focus on the analysis of available data for the year 2017.

Our aim is to estimate the cost of a positive and of a positive imbalance for wind and solar generation relatively to the spot price level.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height = 12, fig.width = 12, fig.cap="Spot and imbalance prices, sun and wind generation in France, one week of january, june and december"}
do.call(grid.arrange, do.call(list, unlist(ppp_lst, recursive=FALSE)))
#do.call(grid.arrange, ppp_lst[[1]])
#do.call(grid.arrange, ppp_lst[[2]]) 
#do.call(grid.arrange, ppp_lst[[3]])
```
